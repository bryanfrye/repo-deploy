#### repo-deploy

This is a POC at the moment.  If you find it, I do not expect it to work 100% of the time.  It is a work in progress.

When finished, it will be a tool to deploy cloud resources from a repository.  It will use the repository to determine what resources to deploy, and then deploy them using the cloud provider's API.

Current work is being done on AWS, but it should be easy to extend to other cloud providers.
